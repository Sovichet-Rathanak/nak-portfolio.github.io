                <p>I have worked on various projects throughout my academic and personal journey, ranging from web development to game development. 
                   Here are some highlights:

                           <strong class="project_header"><h3 exp_header>Game Project</h3></strong>
                           <p class = "project_desc">This project was developed using C# in combination with Unity Engine, throughout the development I deepened my understanding of key programming concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), inheritance, classes, and interfaces. 
                            This project also provided valuable insight into the overall process of game development, from concept to execution.</p>

                                I was able to learn a lot about Javascript and how to design a user friendly interface.

                            <p class = "project_desc">This project was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and provided me with a foundational understanding of Automata Theory. 
                                Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with key concepts such as the conversion between Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and Nondeterministic Finite Automata (NFA). 
                                By implementing these automata in code, I was able to better grasp their theoretical principles and see their practical applications. 
                                This experience deepened my knowledge of computational theory and improved my skills in both programming and algorithm design.
